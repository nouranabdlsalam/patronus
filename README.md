# Patronus

Patronus is an AI-powered anti-malware and application-level network threat detection system for Android devices developed as a graduation project at Alexandria University. It leverages AI to detect malware based on permission patterns and contextual factors, while also monitoring network activity at the application level. The system is designed to run efficiently on physical Android devices without root access or elevated privileges.

## Key Features

Patronus is composed of seven core modules that work together to provide comprehensive mobile threat defense:

- **AI-Powered Malware Detection**: Uses permission-based neural networks enriched with behavioral profiles of six Android malware families.
- **Context-Aware Risk Scoring**: Dynamically adjusts threat evaluation based on app category and expected behavior to reduce false positives.
- **IP-Level Threat Monitoring**: Detects malicious app behavior by tracking outbound connections to known bad IPs.
- **Wi-Fi Threat Scanner**: Evaluates Wi-Fi network configurations for security issues and suggests mitigation.
- **Configurable Security Modes:** Three levels of protection (Low, Balanced, High) to suit user preferences for performance and security.
- **Threat Remediation**: Receives malware and network threats and proposes remediation options according to the threat type.
- **Interactive HelpBot**: A built-in assistant powered by an LLM that explains alerts and provides remediation tips.
