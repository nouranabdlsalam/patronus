## Overview
Patronus is an advanced Android security application designed to provide real-time protection against modern cyber threats targeting mobile devices. Unlike traditional antivirus tools that focus on known malware, Patronus leverages AI-powered behavior-based detection to identify zero-day threats and suspicious activities from newly installed or existing apps. It also includes a robust network scanning feature to detect unsafe public Wi-Fi networks, ensuring comprehensive device and network security.

## Features
- **AI-Based Malware Detection:** Real-time monitoring of app behaviors to detect malicious activities.
- **Configurable Security Modes:** Three levels of protection (Low, Balanced, High) to suit user preferences for performance and security.
- **App-Level Network Monitor:** Continuous monitoring of app connections against a dynamic database of known malicious IPs.
- **Wi-Fi Network Scanner:** Analyzes public Wi-Fi security, providing detailed assessments and troubleshooting suggestions.
- **AI-Driven Chatbot (HelpBot):** Offers real-time support, security explanations, and user guidance powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, responsive design with intuitive screens for malware scanning, network diagnostics, and threat remediation.

## Problem Statement
As mobile devices become integral to daily life, they face increasing threats from malicious apps, insecure Wi-Fi networks, and sophisticated cyberattacks. Existing solutions often fail to provide proactive defenses or real-time behavioral analysis. Patronus addresses these gaps by offering intelligent, adaptable protection that keeps users informed and secure.

## Project Objectives
